# OPT Project Code Repository

## Overview

This code repository contains the source code for our OPT (Optical Projection Tomography) project. The code is organized into different folders based on their functionalities and implementations.

### Folders

1. **Matlab:**
   - The Matlab folder includes partial implementations of the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART) for OPT.

2. **Python:**
   - **2D Reconstruction:**
     - Within this subfolder, you can find the implementation of SART and ML-EM algorithms for 2D image reconstruction in the OPT project.

    - **env:**
      - This shell script is designed for configuring the Python environment. However, it is important to note that CUDA and GCC need to be installed for proper functionality.
